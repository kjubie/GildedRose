# GildedRose
My take on the Gilded Rose Coding Kata.

This Kata was originally created by [Terry Hughes](https://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/). [Emily Bache](https://twitter.com/emilybache) translated the original C# into a few other languages. She wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://emilybache.blogspot.se/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-gilded-rose-kata.html) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).
